# Pyshift

A perspective correction library for OpenCV images ported from the Darktable Ashift module (https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable/blob/release-4.1.0/src/iop/ashift.c)
which itself was based on ShiftN (https://www.shiftn.de).

## Roadmap

- [] Expose flags to allow for more customization of algoritmn (i.e Disable/Enable Rotation)
- [] Validate inputs
- [] Write tests
- [] Exit in a way python treats as an error
- [] Publish to Pypi
- [] Trim code what's needed and rename dt prefixes
